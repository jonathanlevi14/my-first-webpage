  <h1>This is my Pet Molka</h1>
  <h2>This half Brittany half Rat Terrier is my dog.</h2>
  <p>We got Molka on Feburary of 2018 in Portland, Oregon</p>
  <p>Molka has some things she loves to do.</p>
  <h2>MOLKAS FAVORITE THINGS TO DO</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Sun Bathe</li>
      <img src="img/sunbathe.jpg" alt="man sunbathing in lawn chair">
    <li>Curl up in her bed</li>
    <li>Tell us she needs something</li>
  </ul>

  <p>When Molka was a puppy she was very hyperactive. 
    She loved to run and jump, play fetch, and tug-o-war.
